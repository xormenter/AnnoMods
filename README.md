## Industrialized Low Tier Production

### About

Anno 1800 is all about the age of industrialization. Yet in the game, we cannot industrialize the low tier goods production and instead have to place down thousands of them.
This mod fixes this problem by introducing advanced production chains, unlocked at the artisan level, that allow you to produce much more goods with fewer (but larger) buildings. To balance this, the new factories are more expensive and all require worker-workforce instead of farmers.

All buildings have 3d models and animated workers.

There are two seperate downloads, one contains the fishery and the other everything else.
Overview:

- Large Fishery: Produces fish. With its big trawler, it produces 4 fish/minute, but in contrast to the normal fishery, it can also benefit from electricity.
- Textile Factory: Produces work clothes. Uses the 3d model of the advanced cotton production, but with the framework knitter texture. Produces a total of 12 work clothes per minute, but requires electricity for this.
- Electrical Flour Mill: Produces 12 flour/minute, requires electricity. Can explode...
- Large Bakery: Produces 3 bread per minute, can be improved with electricity.
- Large Schnapps Destillery: Produces 6 schnapps per minute. Can be improved with electricity.
- Advanced Sawmill (Old World and New World): 12 timber per minute. Can be improved with electricity.
- Advanced Sailmaker: 4 sails per minute. Can be improved with electricity. 2 Variations, one with asphalt and one with grass & dirt ground.
- Large Steel Furnace: 4 steel per minute, can be improved with electricitiy.
- Large Steelworks: 2 steel beams per minute, can be improved with electricity.
- Sausage Factory: 6 sausages per minute. Can be improved with electricity.
- Large Rendering Works (Tallow)
- Large Soap Factory
- Industrial Pig Farm (requires a silo supplied with Corn + Potatoes; gets a -1000% productivity debuff unless it is supplied with food)
- Industrial Cattle Farm(requires a silo supplied with Corn + Grain), allows the production of milk from cattle using the 'fertilizer' module

Thanks to Jakob for making the flour mill ground decal and the wonderful modular ground decal package.

## Cattle Needs to be Butchered

Don't you find it a bit weird that a pig farm produces pigs while a cattle farm produces ... meat? Then this mod is for you: Cattle farms now produce cattle instead of meat. The cattle then needs to be butchered at a butchery before its meat can be processed.
Adds two 3d models for the butchery (NW/OW).
The butchery unlocks at 1 artisan. The old world variant employs workers, the new world one jornaleros. Both have a production time of 30s.
Also adds an bigger version of the OW butchery with a production time of 10 seconds.

## Small Pier

Personally, I find the default pier in Anno 1800 quite... ugly. It just doesn't fit nicely in my harbors.
So I made these smaller pier that do not have a big building and thus fit into any harbor you can imagine. They are  variations of the normal/advanced pier, so no extra building. With appropriate variations (feedback units) for OW, NW, Enbesa.

It comes in 4 variants:

- Short
- Long (looks much better if you have long ships like clippers)
- Short Diagonal
- Long Diagonal

## Diagonal Harbor

Adds diagonal variations to:

- Depots
- Defenses
- Repair Cranes

(For the Old World, the New World, Enbesa and the Arctic)
The diagonal depots have almost no blocking, this allows you to place them relatively freely, yet you must also be careful to not build weird looking things. I don't know if the AI can handle it.
Adds an ornamental loading pier (both straight and diagonal) that fits nicely with my other mod here Small and Diagonal Quays
